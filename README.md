trying build an proof of concept for custom ad recommendation engine based on user LLM chat history;
plan:
build an batch processing pipeline for topic modelling using top2vec and then recommendation engine on top based on relevancy,time decay,user persona,etc.
what-if moment was:
what-if we can monitize users LLM interaction through personalized ADsðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ
imagine getting ad recommendations based on:"fix my code for ...","teach me javascript or something else idk ,etc","write an email for.."ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†;
I mean it was kind of fun trying build it over a weekend.and yeah also used conversation from my chatgpt for training top2vec
;
