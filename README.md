so here is the basic chain of thought process before coming up with this idea:
1.what if in few years we stop using traditional serach engines and shift towards LLM search engines
i mean google makes about 150-200 billion dollars from personalized ads and ads ,so there will still be demand for personalized ads right?
so what if we can monitize peoples AI interactions i mean may be in few years people might do all sorts of things like shoping,automating things with AI agents 
question is how can we monitize there interactions right?
so here is an basic proof of concept of ad engine that can process natural language text and suggest customized ads.

system overview:

trying build an proof of concept for custom ad recommendation engine based on user LLM chat history;
plan:
build an batch processing pipeline for topic modelling using top2vec and then recommendation engine on top based on relevancy,time decay,user persona,etc.
what-if moment was:
what-if we can monitize users LLM interaction through personalized ADsðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ
imagine getting ad recommendations based on:"fix my code for ...","teach me javascript or something else idk ,etc","write an email for.."ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†;
I mean it was kind of fun trying build it over a weekend.and yeah also used conversation from my chatgpt for training top2vec
